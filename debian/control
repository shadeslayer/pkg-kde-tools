Description: common makesnippets and other build scripts for KDE4 related packages
 This package contains makefiles setting the default build arguments for KDE4 
 packages.
 .
 Currently, it is only a few makesnippets, but it will grow larger in the future.
 .
 NOTE: if you use cdbs or debhelper, you need to build-depend on those as well,
 as this package is expected to be useful in cases without debhelper or cdbs.
