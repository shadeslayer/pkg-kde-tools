Description: common makesnippets and build scripts for KDE4 related packages
 This package contains makefiles setting the default build arguments for KDE4
 packages.
 .
 Currently, it contains a few makesnippets, and pkgkde-symbolshelper tool,
 but it will grow larger in the future.
 .
 NOTE: if you use cdbs or debhelper, you need to build-depend on those as well,
 as this package is expected to be useful in cases without debhelper or cdbs.
