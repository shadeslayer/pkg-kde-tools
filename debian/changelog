pkg-kde-tools (0.4.0~pre5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: add support for resorting symbol files (useful after
    manual editing).
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper create: add support for adding arch specific symbols
    to the symbol template.
  * Add dh_sameversiondep from official KDE packaging:
    - make pkg-kde-tools suggest debhelper v7 and dpkg-dev;
    - add POD help and generate manual page from it;
    - add support for the external reference package.
  * Pass -X.svn to dh_install
  * Add stuff from svn pkg-kde/cdbs as qt-kde-team. Port kde.mk and rename
    it to debian-qt-kde.mk as it was called in kde3 when stored in cdbs/ dir.
    - use /usr/share/pkg-kde-tools/makefiles/1/variables.mk;
    - link with --as-needed by default;
    - remove lintian section, we should use dh_lintian;
    - add README to discourage other developers from using qt-kde-team.
  * Add makefiles/1/cdbs/symbolshelper.mk which hooks pkgkde-symbolshelper
    calls to cdbs.
  * Add "distro policy" checking when building the package:
    - THIS_SHOULD_GO_TO_UNSTABLE moved policy/unstable.mk
    - policy/unstable.mk also emits a warning when KDE alpha or betas are to
      be uploaded to unstable.

pkg-kde-tools (0.3.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-symbolshelper/patch: improve processing of patches which patch
    multiple files. Use the first patch portion that applies properly.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper/patch: rename -p parameter to -d (diff), support -p
    (package) option.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: rework module stucture a bit, merge small handlers
    into one file.
  * debian/rules: disable .svn check. It is wrong and useless since does not
    check the tarball itself but the directory the tarball gets built from.
  * add support for int64_t/uint64_t differences on 64bit/32bit arches.

  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Tweak description.
  * Add DM-Upload-Allowed: yes.
