pkg-kde-tools (0.14.0~pre1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low


 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Tue, 24 May 2011 21:47:52 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.13.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix sections libdlrestrictions1 and libdlrestrictions-dev (libs and
    libdevel respectively).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2: no changes needed.
  * Relicense DLRestrictions under less troublesome LGPLv2.1.
  * While installing, preserve source permissions of files in cmake, makefiles,
    qt-kde-team and some other directories. This solves unexecutable scripts
    problem.

pkg-kde-tools (0.13.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-vcs tag: allow 'stable' in the changelog distribution field.
  * Implement CMake based build system for the package.
  * Add DLRestrictions library. Check descriptions of new binary packages
    (namely libdlrestrictions1 and libdlrestrictions-dev) for more information.
  * Beginings of unit test implementation for the  DLRestrictions library. They
    do not work yet though.
  * Ship verbatim texts of the GPL-3 (COPYING.GPL-3), GPL-2 (COPYING.GPL-2) and
    LGPL-3 (COPYING.LGPL-3) licenses in the source package.
  * Bump packaging copyright years in debian/copyright.

pkg-kde-tools (0.12.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-getbuildlogs: fix fetching of last logs.
  * pkgkde-getbuildlogs: assume logs are in UTF-8. Fixes perl warning.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Mon, 02 May 2011 00:36:31 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.12.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implement and add DebianABIManager. Refer to
    /usr/share/doc/pkg-kde-tools/README.DebianABIManager for more information.
  * Since kdelibs5-dev 4.6.1, ENABLE_LIBKDEINIT_RUNPATH defaults to ON whenever
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debian.
  * Fix a typo in qt-kde-team/2/library-packages.mk: makes
    libpkgs_addsubst_allLibraries work.
  * qt-kde-team/2/debian-qt-kde.mk: attach debian/stamp-man-pages properly.
    dh_auto_build is executed when build* targets are run, not binary*.
  * Rename 'overriden_command' to 'overridden_command' (which is correct
    spelling). But keep 'overriden_command' as an alias for now.
  * Switch debian/rules engine to home-grown dhmk. This might help to
    detect regressions and might ease testing and development process.
  * qt-kde-team/2/library-packages.mk: libpkgs_gen_strict_local_shlibs no
    longer depends on the presence of the respective DEBIAN/*/shlibs.
  * Fix dh examples in README.Debian to be dh compat=8 compatible.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Apr 2011 11:58:46 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.11.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * qt-kde-team/1: set old kde4 flags before including variables.mk hence some
    hacks (like DEB_CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR stuff) will work as before.
    (Closes: #618200)

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Mar 2011 23:42:22 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.11.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * "Innocent" backtick in the echo statement causes packages to FTBFS. Fix it.
  * Some tweaks to qt-kde-team/2/list-missing.mk.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Mar 2011 21:40:03 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.11.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for list-missing target to qt-kde-team/2/*.
  * Minor language tweaks to the echos/comments in dhmk.mk.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Mar 2011 17:05:43 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.11.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move most of kde4_flags to qt-kde-team/1/debian-qt-kde.mk as absolute
    majority of them are kde4libs specific anyway. This is done in order to
    avoid cmake 2.8.4 warnings about unused variables and unnecessary
    duplication of configuration.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Mar 2011 20:25:23 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.11.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * dhmk.mk: add a shortcut variable $(overriden_command) for getting full
    original command line of the overriden command in the override targets.
  * Some bug fixes and performance improvements for the whole qt-kde-team/2
    debian/rules build engine.
  * It's highly recommended for qt-kde-team/2/debian-qt-kde.mk based packages
    to build-depend on pkg-kde-tools 0.11 now.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Mar 2011 03:18:56 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.10.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implement a new build debian/rules build engine (dubbed dhmk) for Qt/KDE
    team packages. See qt-kde-team/2/README for more information.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Wed, 09 Mar 2011 15:44:39 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.9.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make pkgkde-getbuildlogs work with new infrastructure on
    https://buildd.debian.org.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Feb 2011 19:23:20 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.9.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump Standards-Verstion to 3.9.1: no changes needed.
  * Fix "dpkg: * has bad syntax: invalid character in revision number" error
    which debhelper kde buildsystem used to spit (it wasn't fatal though).
  * Use perl API in place of dpkg --compare-versions (kde buildsystem).
  * Add lintian override for "capitalization-error-in-description kde KDE".

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Feb 2011 12:46:01 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.9.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use a new tag message style in `pkgkde-vcs tag`:
    <version> <distribution>; urgency=<urgency>

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Jul 2010 02:02:54 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.9.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add libdpkg-perl (>= 1.15.6~) to Build-Depends. Needed for symbolshelper
    syntax checks.
  * Add support for DEB_KDE_LINK_WITH_NO_UNDEFINED (defaults to
    DEB_KDE_LINK_WITH_AS_NEEDED value) to variables.mk.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Jun 2010 11:30:50 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.9.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-getbuildlogs: load HTTP::Request & friends in the INIT block in
    order to pass syntax check without libwww-perl installed (Closes: #584375).

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Fri, 04 Jun 2010 01:04:28 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop deprecated `pkgkde-symbolshelper symbolfile` support from
    cdbs/symbolshelper.mk.
  * qt-kde-team/1/debian-qt-kde.mk: enable quilt patchsystem only if 
    quilt is in Build-Depends. This adds support for 3.0 (quilt) source format.
  * Switch HTML_INSTALL_DIR from /usr/share/doc/kde4/HTML to
    /usr/share/doc/kde/HTML, add NEWS entry about this important change which
    may trigger FTBFSes in the third party packages.
  * debian-qt-kde.mk: replace usr/share/doc/kde4 references with
    usr/share/doc/kde.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Tue, 01 Jun 2010 01:05:57 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.8.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: disable symbol file backups by default.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: do not bump symbol minimum version when the only
    change made is detection of substs in the original symbol.
  * Add run-local wrapper for easy execution of scripts directly from the
    source package.
  * Add support for perl tests under t/*.t subdirectory to Makefile.
  * Add t/perl_syntax_check.t for checking syntax of the perl scripts in
    the package.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: drop symbolfile and postgensymbols subcommands
    that were deprecated long ago.
  * Bump major version number due to removal of deprecated options (and
    possible introduction of FTBFSes for packages which still use them).

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Fri, 14 May 2010 23:13:52 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.7.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-gensymbols: add vim modeline.
  * pkgkde-gensymbols: no longer check dpkg version. It is 1) pointless now
    as pkg-kde-tools depends on the appropriate libdpkg-perl version and 2)
    the check is inaccurate for our needs as it checks the version of the dpkg
    binary rather than dpkg-dev package.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Apr 2010 00:03:14 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.7.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-gensymbols: exclude self when looking for dpkg-gensymbols in PATH.
    This should fix endless loop when do()ing system dpkg-gensymbols.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Apr 2010 00:09:52 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove workaround introduced in 0.7.0.1: no longer needed.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: allow to specify confirmed arches for *patch.
  * Depend on libdpkg-perl (>= 1.15.6~), recommend dpkg-dev of the same
    version and break earlier dpkg-dev versions.
  * No longer ship a backported dpkg-gensymbols.pl script. The one from
    dpkg-dev (>= 1.15.6) is enough now. As a result, make appropriate changes
    to pkgkde-gensymbols.
  * Drop dpkg-dev 1.15.4 compatibility code from dh_sameversiondep.
  * Make dh_sameversiondep work with libdpkg-perl (>= 1.15.6) (Dpkg::Substvars
    API changed). Thanks to Roderich Schupp for the patch (Closes: #577056).
  * No longer ship stable (v1.0) libdpkg-perl interfaces in pkg-kde-tools.
    Therefore, rm -rf datalib/Dpkg/Compression* datalib/Dpkg/Interface.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Apr 2010 10:57:29 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.7.0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Remove perl from pkg-kde-tools Depends to workaround (and use to our own
    advantage) brokeness in experimental buildds.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Thu, 08 Apr 2010 13:41:29 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.7.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * `pkgkde-symbolshelper *`: properly handle the case when some substs have
    been detected but symbols differences still remain (rare variant of
    "possible incomplete subst detection"). libakonadi-kde4 in kdepimlibs was
    hit by this bug.
  * Add a new tool `pkgkde-getbuildlogs` that can be used to get
    build logs from https://buildd.debian.org for the specified package.
  * Move kde4_flags to /usr/share/pkg-kde-tools/lib subdir.
  * `pkgkde-symbolshelper *patch`: properly assign version that was chosen in
    the prompt.
  * Completely drop makefiles/1/debhelper/kde.mk. It was deprecated in 0.5.
  * Improve pkg-kde-tools package description. Now it contains short
    descriptions of all tools the package provides.
  * Reword dh_sameversiondep manual page a bit.
  * Recommend libwww-perl.
  * Reorganize source package directory structure:
    - get rid of symbolshelper, debhelper, vcs subdirectires. Move perl modules
      to perllib subdirectory and the rest to the top of the source tree;
    - unify how datalibdir is found and exported in the Debian::PkgKde module
      ({find,setup}_datalibdir()). Make pkgkde-gensymbols and
      pkgkde-symbolshelper use these new subroutines;
    - change datalib path in pkgkde-deb2symbols;
    - rewrite Makefile for reorganized source tree.
  * Update debian/copyright.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Mar 2010 02:58:34 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add dh_sodeps helper program for autogenering dependencies for library
    development packages based on the targets *.so symlinks point to.
  * Add dh addon "sodeps" for dh_sodeps.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Wed, 03 Mar 2010 04:27:52 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Instruct cdbs to handle DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel for team packages rather
    than rely on dpkg-buildpackage -jN to mess with MAKEFLAGS. Team packages
    are parallel safe.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Tue, 02 Mar 2010 13:20:03 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-{symbolshelper,gensymbols}: compatibility fix for dpkg-dev 1.15.6
    retaining compatibility with 1.15.5 as well (Dpkg::IPC::spawn).
  * Use new Dpkg::IPC::spawn() rather than Dpkg::IPC::fork_and_exec() in the
    code.
  * Update code stolen from dpkg-dev to current git master.
  * pkgkde-deb2symbols: be quiet when dumping symbol file.
  * `pkgkde-symbolshelper batchpatch`: improve error messages.
  * Fix patch parsing when patches go one right after another.
  * `pkgkde-symbolshelper rewrite`: understand -v again.
  * Add pkgkde-override-sc-dev-latest command.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Feb 2010 20:56:33 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-debs2symbols: remove 0 size patch files.
  * `pkgkde-symbolshelper batchpatch`: if no packages explicitly specified,
    select only those for which patches exist.
  * Move RPATH "workaround" code for <= KDE 4.3.x from makefiles/1/cdbs/kde.mk
    to makefiles/1/variables.mk hence debian-qt-kde.mk will also use it.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Feb 2010 21:51:40 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add -q option to pkgkde-gensymbols. -c0 will never fail but still generate
    a diff. Use -c0 -q to keep pkgkde-gensymbols completely quiet as before.
  * `pkgkde-symbolshelper create`: make it work with a single input symbol
    file.
  * `pkgkde-symbolshelper rewrite`: avoid dupe c++ aliases after convert in
    some cases.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Feb 2010 02:53:40 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-debs2symbols: allow to specify deb directory (-d option) and
    symbol file directory (-s option).
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: implement `batchpatch` subcommand which is capable of
    patching multiple packages at once (provided current working directory is
    the top of the debian source package tree with symbol files in standard
    locations).
  * `pkgkde-symbolshelper patch`: rename --base|b option to --file-to-patch|f.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: implement --backup option (backs up outfile).

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Feb 2010 21:47:06 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implement dh_movelibkdeinit debhelper program which moves libkdeinit4_*.so
    from public /usr/lib to private /usr/lib/kde4/libkdeinit if RUNPATHs are
    set properly.
  * Add dh_movelibkdeinit helper to debhelper kde addon sequence, CDBS kde.mk
    and debian-qt-kde.mk.
  * Pass new LIBKDEINIT_INSTALL_DIR and ENABLE_LIBKDEINIT_RUNPATH options to
    cmake by default (CDBS kde.mk and debhelper kde buildsystem).
  * No longer globally skip RPATH handling in cmake if kdelibs5-dev is 4:4.4.0
    or higher. kde4libs build system has been properly fixed in 4:4.4.0-1.
  * Omit usr/lib/kde4/ from dh_makeshlibs by default (debian-qt-kde.mk, kde.mk,
    dh kde addon).
  * dh kde addon: exclude kde documentation from dh_compress by default.
  * Add qt-kde-team/1/library-packages.mk which is capable of:
    - generating and handling ${allLibraries}, ${kde43Libraries} substs;
    - generating strict local shlibs.
  * Improve README.Debian information about dh kde addon.
  * Make dh kde addon return truth value.
  * Compress pkg-kde-tools tarball with bzip2 by default.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Feb 2010 19:36:56 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rework detection of arch specific symbols. This should fix some bugs
    with arch symbol tag processing and generation.
  * Now `pkgkde-symbolshelper create` bases its template on the arch specific
    symbol file (as specified with -a option). This alters arch tag generation
    a bit (negative arches are used more frequently than before).
  * Alter behaviour of -o option:
    - if it is not specified, output is dumped to the same file as input was
      read from;
    - if it is specified without argument, dump to stdout;
    - if it is specified with argument, dump to the file in argument.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper create/patch: arch specific files/patches are passed
    via @ARGV now.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper create/patch: prompt for version if -v is not
    specified on the command line. Good defaults are also suggested.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Sat, 06 Feb 2010 23:43:07 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * "SymbolsHelper Reloaded" release.

  * Remove DMUA field from debian/control which was added for me.
  * Provide newer dpkg-gensymbols as pkgkde-gensymbols.
  * Make it possible to replace dpkg-gensymbols with pkgkde-gensymbols
    (by adding /usr/share/pkg-kde-tools/bin to $PATH).
  * Use my @debian.org address in the Uploaders field.
  * Helpers for adding /usr/share/pkg-kde-tools/bin to $PATH:
    - implement this in cdbs/symbolshelper.mk;
    - new pkgkde_symbolshelper dh addon takes care of this for dh(1).
  * Port pkgkde-symbolshelper to the latest dpkg-dev symbols API.
    Most subcomands as of 0.4.0 are supported, some are no longer needed.
  * Add support for substitutions directly to pkgkde-gensymbols
    (dpkg-gensymbols wrapper). This renders `pkgkde-symbolshelper symbolfile`
    obsolete.
  * Switch to 3.0 (native) format: ignores VCS directories by default.
  * Update my address in the code copyright notices.
  * Update debian/copyright.
  * Add pkgkde-debs2symbols utility which is capable of:
    - auto-downloading library binary packages for all available architectures;
    - creating raw arch-specific symbol files based on the contents of the
      binary packages. Those symbol files can be later fed to
      `pkgkde-symbolshelper create`;
    - generating arch-specific dpkg-gensymbols diffs between the reference
      symbol file template and actual contents of the (later) binary packages.
      Like build logs, those patches can be later fed to `pkgkde-symbolshelper
      patch`.
  * Add multi-arch/multi-patch support to `pkgkde-symbolshelper patch`. Now, it
    is capable of patching symbol file template for multiple arches (using
    multiple patches) at the same time. All revelevant information is
    kept/merged, arch tags are managed automatically whenever possible.
    Incremental patching is also supported.
  * Add support for detection/expansion of the qprtdiff and quintptr substs (Qt
    types).
  * Promote dpkg-dev to Recommends, bump needed version to 1.15.5~.
  * Remove dpkg-dev from Breaks.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.4: no changes needed.
  * Fix lintian "I: hyphen-used-as-minus-sign
    usr/share/man/man1/pkgkde-vcs.1.gz:97"

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Feb 2010 20:09:10 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.5.3) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Wed, 18 Nov 2009 02:31:00 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add pkgkde-vcs helper tool for performing various common tasks
    when packaging with version control system repositories. As of this commit
    the only VCS supported is Git which supports 'tag' subcommand for tagging
    debian package releases when as they are uploaded Debian.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to shut up lintian.

pkg-kde-tools (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split off KDE 4 cmake flags from variables.mk to the text file.
  * Create debhelper subdir and move dh_sameversiondep to it.
  * Add a kde build system for debhelper (>= 7.3).
  * Add a kde sequence addon (template) for debhelper (>= 7.3.16).
  * Deprecate debhelper/kde.mk snippet. Use kde build system/sequence addon
    instead.
  * Remove extra slashes from debian/install.
  * Switch debian/rules to dh. Update build dependencies and compat

    debhelper/kde.mk follows.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Fri, 24 Jul 2009 15:17:47 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.10) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add a basic debhelper/kde.mk snippet which automatically passes KDE cmake
    flags to dh_auto_configure and runs dh $@ by default. Either of defaults
    can be overriden as needed.
  * Update debian/README.Debian with details about dh(1) support.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.2: no changes needed.
  * Suggest debhelper (>= 7.3.0) which includes dh(1) with cmake support.

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.9) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * Clarify comment in variables.mk.
  * Install severily stripped down version of pkgkde-symbolshelper which
    is compatible with dpkg-dev >= 1.15.3. This version is inappropriate
    to generate/patch new symbols, it is here just to avoid breaking
    old packages. While dpkg-dev 1.15.3 has some big improvements, they
    are still not enough to properly support most C++ libraries.

  [ Raúl Sánchez Siles ]
  * Remove usage of deprecated dh_desktop.

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add maintainer check to debian_qt_kde.mk to disallow anybody else but
    Debian Qt/KDE Maintainers to use this snippet (i.e. for official KDE
    packages only). The check is supposed to support Kubuntu packages too.

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: add support for resorting symbol files (useful after
    manual editing).
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper create: add support for adding arch specific symbols
    to the symbol template.
  * Add dh_sameversiondep from official KDE packaging:
    - make pkg-kde-tools suggest debhelper v7 and dpkg-dev;
    - add POD help and generate manual page from it;
    - add support for the external reference package.
  * Pass -X.svn to dh_install
  * Add makefiles/1/cdbs/symbolshelper.mk which hooks pkgkde-symbolshelper
    calls to cdbs.
  * Add stuff from svn pkg-kde/cdbs as qt-kde-team. Port kde.mk and rename
    it to debian-qt-kde.mk as it was called in kde3 when stored in cdbs/ dir.
    - use /usr/share/pkg-kde-tools/makefiles/1/variables.mk;
    - link with --as-needed by default;
    - remove lintian section, we should use dh_lintian;
    - add README to discourage other developers from using qt-kde-team;
    - enable pkgkde-symbolshelper support in debian-qt-kde.mk by defaylt.
  * Add "distro policy" checking when building the package:
    - THIS_SHOULD_GO_TO_UNSTABLE moved policy/unstable.mk
    - policy/unstable.mk also emits a warning when KDE alpha or betas are to
      be uploaded to unstable.

pkg-kde-tools (0.3.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-symbolshelper/patch: improve processing of patches which patch
    multiple files. Use the first patch portion that applies properly.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper/patch: rename -p parameter to -d (diff), support -p
    (package) option.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: rework module stucture a bit, merge small handlers
    into one file.
  * debian/rules: disable .svn check. It is wrong and useless since does not
    check the tarball itself but the directory the tarball gets built from.
  * add support for int64_t/uint64_t differences on 64bit/32bit arches.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Wed, 14 Jan 2009 14:18:17 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Tweak description.
  * Add DM-Upload-Allowed: yes.
