pkg-kde-tools (0.6.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-debs2symbols: allow to specify deb directory (-d option) and
    symbol file directory (-s option).
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: implement `batchpatch` subcommand which is capable of
    patching multiple packages at once (provided current working directory is
    the top of the debian source package tree with symbol files in standard
    locations).
  * `pkgkde-symbolshelper patch`: rename --base|b option to --file-to-patch|f.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: implement --backup option (backs up outfile).

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implement dh_movelibkdeinit debhelper program which moves libkdeinit4_*.so
    from public /usr/lib to private /usr/lib/kde4/libkdeinit if RUNPATHs are
    set properly.
  * Add dh_movelibkdeinit helper to debhelper kde addon sequence, CDBS kde.mk
    and debian-qt-kde.mk.
  * Pass new LIBKDEINIT_INSTALL_DIR and ENABLE_LIBKDEINIT_RUNPATH options to
    cmake by default (CDBS kde.mk and debhelper kde buildsystem).
  * No longer globally skip RPATH handling in cmake if kdelibs5-dev is 4:4.4.0
    or higher. kde4libs build system has been properly fixed in 4:4.4.0-1.
  * Omit usr/lib/kde4/ from dh_makeshlibs by default (debian-qt-kde.mk, kde.mk,
    dh kde addon).
  * dh kde addon: exclude kde documentation from dh_compress by default.
  * Add qt-kde-team/1/library-packages.mk which is capable of:
    - generating and handling ${allLibraries}, ${kde43Libraries} substs;
    - generating strict local shlibs.
  * Improve README.Debian information about dh kde addon.
  * Make dh kde addon return truth value.
  * Compress pkg-kde-tools tarball with bzip2 by default.

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rework detection of arch specific symbols. This should fix some bugs
    with arch symbol tag processing and generation.
  * Now `pkgkde-symbolshelper create` bases its template on the arch specific
    symbol file (as specified with -a option). This alters arch tag generation
    a bit (negative arches are used more frequently than before).
  * Alter behaviour of -o option:
    - if it is not specified, output is dumped to the same file as input was
      read from;
    - if it is specified without argument, dump to stdout;
    - if it is specified with argument, dump to the file in argument.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper create/patch: arch specific files/patches are passed
    via @ARGV now.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper create/patch: prompt for version if -v is not
    specified on the command line. Good defaults are also suggested.

pkg-kde-tools (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * "SymbolsHelper Reloaded" release.

  * Remove DMUA field from debian/control which was added for me.
  * Provide newer dpkg-gensymbols as pkgkde-gensymbols.
  * Make it possible to replace dpkg-gensymbols with pkgkde-gensymbols
    (by adding /usr/share/pkg-kde-tools/bin to $PATH).
  * Use my @debian.org address in the Uploaders field.
  * Helpers for adding /usr/share/pkg-kde-tools/bin to $PATH:
    - implement this in cdbs/symbolshelper.mk;
    - new pkgkde_symbolshelper dh addon takes care of this for dh(1).
  * Port pkgkde-symbolshelper to the latest dpkg-dev symbols API.
    Most subcomands as of 0.4.0 are supported, some are no longer needed.
  * Add support for substitutions directly to pkgkde-gensymbols
    (dpkg-gensymbols wrapper). This renders `pkgkde-symbolshelper symbolfile`
    obsolete.
  * Switch to 3.0 (native) format: ignores VCS directories by default.
  * Update my address in the code copyright notices.
  * Update debian/copyright.
  * Add pkgkde-debs2symbols utility which is capable of:
    - auto-downloading library binary packages for all available architectures;
    - creating raw arch-specific symbol files based on the contents of the
      binary packages. Those symbol files can be later fed to
      `pkgkde-symbolshelper create`;
    - generating arch-specific dpkg-gensymbols diffs between the reference
      symbol file template and actual contents of the (later) binary packages.
      Like build logs, those patches can be later fed to `pkgkde-symbolshelper
      patch`.
  * Add multi-arch/multi-patch support to `pkgkde-symbolshelper patch`. Now, it
    is capable of patching symbol file template for multiple arches (using
    multiple patches) at the same time. All revelevant information is
    kept/merged, arch tags are managed automatically whenever possible.
    Incremental patching is also supported.
  * Add support for detection/expansion of the qprtdiff and quintptr substs (Qt
    types).
  * Promote dpkg-dev to Recommends, bump needed version to 1.15.5~.
  * Remove dpkg-dev from Breaks.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.4: no changes needed.
  * Fix lintian "I: hyphen-used-as-minus-sign
    usr/share/man/man1/pkgkde-vcs.1.gz:97"

 -- Modestas Vainius <modax@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Feb 2010 20:09:10 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for dpkg-dev 1.15.5 to dh_sameversiondep.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Wed, 18 Nov 2009 02:31:00 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add pkgkde-vcs helper tool for performing various common tasks
    when packaging with version control system repositories. As of this commit
    the only VCS supported is Git which supports 'tag' subcommand for tagging
    debian package releases when as they are uploaded Debian.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to shut up lintian.

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3: no changes needed.
  * Add © in copyright file instead of (C).

  * Create debhelper subdir and move dh_sameversiondep to it.
  * Add a kde build system for debhelper (>= 7.3).
  * Add a kde sequence addon (template) for debhelper (>= 7.3.16).

    instead.
  * Remove extra slashes from debian/install.
  * Switch debian/rules to dh. Update build dependencies and compat
    accordingly.

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debhelper 7.3.7 has been upload to unstable, pkg-kde-tools with
    debhelper/kde.mk follows.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Fri, 24 Jul 2009 15:17:47 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.10) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add a basic debhelper/kde.mk snippet which automatically passes KDE cmake
    flags to dh_auto_configure and runs dh $@ by default. Either of defaults
    can be overriden as needed.
  * Update debian/README.Debian with details about dh(1) support.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.2: no changes needed.
  * Suggest debhelper (>= 7.3.0) which includes dh(1) with cmake support.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Thu, 02 Jul 2009 20:12:07 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.9) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Modestas Vainius ]
  * Clarify comment in variables.mk.
  * Install severily stripped down version of pkgkde-symbolshelper which
    is compatible with dpkg-dev >= 1.15.3. This version is inappropriate
    to generate/patch new symbols, it is here just to avoid breaking
    old packages. While dpkg-dev 1.15.3 has some big improvements, they
    are still not enough to properly support most C++ libraries.

  [ Raúl Sánchez Siles ]
  * Remove usage of deprecated dh_desktop.

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add maintainer check to debian_qt_kde.mk to disallow anybody else but
    Debian Qt/KDE Maintainers to use this snippet (i.e. for official KDE
    packages only). The check is supposed to support Kubuntu packages too.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Wed, 27 May 2009 13:42:22 +0300

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.7) unstable; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * dpkg 1.15.1 entered unstable, so pkg-kde-tools 0.4.7 follows.
  * Change Conflicts to Breaks on dpkg-dev/kdelibs5 (more apppropriate in
    this case).

  +++ Changes by Fathi Boudra:

  * Re-word README.Debian:
    - use 80 colons max
    - add a note on DEB_KDE_LINK_AS_NEEDED usage
    - improve debhelper snippet based on dh-make template
    - fix typo kde4.mk -> kde.mk
    - remove extra lines

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Restore pkgkde-symbolshelper compatibility with dpkg-dev 1.15.0. This
    breaks compatibility with dpkg-dev (<< 1.15) though. Add conflicts.
  * Small dpkg-dev 1.15.0 compatibility fix for dh_sameversiondep.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Sun, 29 Mar 2009 15:26:12 +0300

 -- Sune Vuorela <debian@pusling.com>  Wed, 01 Apr 2009 22:23:23 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Vcs fields to debian/control (Git).
  * Get rid of custom bug file processing in qt-kde-team/1/debian-qt-kde.mk.
    This is handled by dh_bugfiles now.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Wed, 11 Mar 2009 13:57:19 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

pkg-kde-tools (0.4.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: add support for resorting symbol files (useful after
    manual editing).
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper create: add support for adding arch specific symbols
    to the symbol template.
  * Add dh_sameversiondep from official KDE packaging:
    - make pkg-kde-tools suggest debhelper v7 and dpkg-dev;
    - add POD help and generate manual page from it;
    - add support for the external reference package.
  * Pass -X.svn to dh_install
  * Add makefiles/1/cdbs/symbolshelper.mk which hooks pkgkde-symbolshelper
    calls to cdbs.
  * Add stuff from svn pkg-kde/cdbs as qt-kde-team. Port kde.mk and rename
    it to debian-qt-kde.mk as it was called in kde3 when stored in cdbs/ dir.
    - use /usr/share/pkg-kde-tools/makefiles/1/variables.mk;
    - link with --as-needed by default;
    - remove lintian section, we should use dh_lintian;
    - add README to discourage other developers from using qt-kde-team;
    - enable pkgkde-symbolshelper support in debian-qt-kde.mk by defaylt.
  * Add "distro policy" checking when building the package:
    - THIS_SHOULD_GO_TO_UNSTABLE moved policy/unstable.mk
    - policy/unstable.mk also emits a warning when KDE alpha or betas are to
      be uploaded to unstable.

pkg-kde-tools (0.3.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-symbolshelper/patch: improve processing of patches which patch
    multiple files. Use the first patch portion that applies properly.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper/patch: rename -p parameter to -d (diff), support -p
    (package) option.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: rework module stucture a bit, merge small handlers
    into one file.
  * debian/rules: disable .svn check. It is wrong and useless since does not
    check the tarball itself but the directory the tarball gets built from.
  * add support for int64_t/uint64_t differences on 64bit/32bit arches.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Wed, 14 Jan 2009 14:18:17 +0200

pkg-kde-tools (0.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add pkgkde-symbolshelper. It aims to make handling of symbols in

    arches due to mangling and other issues.
    - Add GPL3 notice to debian/copyright which pkgkde-symbolshelper is under.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Tweak description.
  * Add DM-Upload-Allowed: yes.

 -- Modestas Vainius <modestas@vainius.eu>  Sat, 29 Nov 2008 16:53:01 +0200
