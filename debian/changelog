pkg-kde-tools (0.3.1~pre3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * pkgkde-symbolshelper/patch: improve processing of patches which patch
    multiple files. Use the first patch portion that applies properly.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper/patch: rename -p parameter to -d (diff), support -p
    (package) option.
  * pkgkde-symbolshelper: rework module stucture a bit, merge small handlers
    into one file.
  * debian/rules: disable .svn check. It is wrong and useless since does not
    check the tarball itself but the directory the tarball gets built from.
