.SH NAME
.B pkgkde\-vcs
\- a helper tool for Debian pkg-kde VCS repositories.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pkgkde\-vcs
[\fB\-vy\fR] \fIsubcommand\fR [ \fISUBCOMMAND OPTIONS\fR ] [ -- \fIEXTERNAL TOOL OPTIONS\fR ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pkgkde\-vcs
is a helper tool which aims to simplify a couple of routine tasks associated
with packaging management in version control system (VCS) repositories.
\fBpkgkde\-vcs\fR transparently supports VCSes used by Debian Qt/KDE maintainer
groups wrapping various VCS related command sequences into a convenient CLI
interface. Please note that this helper enforces the best practises and
packaging conventions adopted by Debian Qt/KDE maintainer groups and therefore
it should not be considered as a general purpose packaging helper.

.B pkgkde\-vcs
should be run from the fully checked out packaging repository of the package it
is supposed to act upon. Firstly, it attempts to detect a VCS in use for
the particular packaging in the working directory. Please note, that the
detection might fail if underlying VCS utilities are not installed. If you want
or have to force a specific VCS type, run the command as \fIpkgkde\-$vcs\fR,
for example \fBpkgkde-git\fR.

If detection is successful, \fBpkgkde\-vcs\fR will perform tasks as defined for
the specified \fIsubcommand\fR (e.g. tag). Different set of subcommands might
be defined for each VCS and each of them might accept a different set of \fISUBCOMMAND
OPTIONS\fR (see below). All locally unrecognized subcommand options (or the
ones specified as \fIEXTERNAL TOOL OPTIONS\fR after \-\-) will be passed to the
external VCS tool(s) which \fBpkgkde\-vcs\fR executes to do the job.

.B pkgkde\-vcs
accepts a couple of \fIcommon options\fR which apply to the
helper as whole or are common for all VCSes it supports. They should be passed
before \fIsubcommand\fR in order to be recognized.

Even if \fBpkgkde\-vcs\fR does extensive sanity checks before doing anything,
an underlying command it executes might still fail. Then \fBpkgkde\-vcs\fR will
terminate immediately possibly leaving repository in an inconsistent state. It is
up to a user to recover from such a failure.

At the moment, \fBpkgkde\-vcs\fR supports only \fIGit\fR VCS.

.SH OPTIONS
.SS Common options
.TP
.B \-y
By default, execution of the first external command that makes changes to the
repository has to be explicitly confirmed by user. However, if this option is
specified, the first command will be run without confirmation.
.TP
.B \-n
Do not run any external commands that make changes to the repository. Useful
with \fB\-v\fR to see what commands with what options would be run.
.TP
.B \-v
Be more verbose (e.g. show external commands as they are executed).
.TP
.BI \-\-\  "\fIEXTERNAL TOOL OPTIONS\fR"
Pass additional \fIEXTERNAL TOOL OPTIONS\fR to the external commands
\fBpkgkde\-vcs\fR executes to accomplish the task. See documentations of the
specific \fIsubcommand\fR for more details.

.SH SUPPORTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS AND SUBCOMMANDS
.SS Git
In order to use \fBpkgkde\-vcs\fR with Git, \fIgit(1)\fR must be available in \fIPATH\fR.
Bare Git repositories are not supported and Git repository should be in fully checked out
state. The following subcommands for Git repositories are supported at the moment:
.TP
.B tag
Tag current packaging state (HEAD) as upload to Debian archive. Repository
working tree must be clean before executing this subcommand. Current package
version and target distribution are automatically determined from
\fIdebian/changelog\fR. Distribution must be a valid Debian suite in order to
avoid tagging of unfinished (aka UNRELEASED) revisions.

The subcommand will create an annotated Git tag under "debian/" namespace. The
subcommand itself does not accept any additional options. All \fIEXTERNAL TOOL
OPTIONS\fR (if specified) and will be passed to \fBgit tag\fR invocation. It is
recommended to sign tags by specifying \fB-s\fR option.

The tag created by \fBpkgkde\-vcs tag\fR will meet the following requirements:
.RS
.IP \(bu
The tag will named as "debian/<version>" where <version> is a full debian
package version without epoch. All occurrences of the ~ character in <version>
will be replaced with the \- character because Git does not support ~ character
in tag names.
.IP \(bu
The tag will be assigned the message with content like
<version>/<distribution>" where <version> is a full debian version of the
package (without any modifications including epoch) and <distribution> is the
distribution this package is uploaded.
.P
For example, a standard \fBpkgkde\-vcs tag\fR will execute the following under
the hood (assuming version is 1:2.3.4-5 and distribution is experimental):
.P
.RS
$ git tag debian/2.3.4-5 \-m "1:2.3.4-5/experimental"
